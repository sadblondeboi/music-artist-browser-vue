Scott 4 also features slightly less ornate orchestral arrangements, opting instead for a more skeletal sound with greater emphasis on the rhythm section."

        "Was an American-born British singer-songwriter, composer and record producer. Walker was known for his baritone voice and an unorthodox career path which took him from 1960s teen pop icon to 21st-century avant-garde musician. Walker's success was largely in the United Kingdom, where his first four solo albums reached the top ten. He lived in the UK from 1965 and became a UK citizen in 1970."
