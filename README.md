# Music-App aka 'GeniusButBetter'

### Project view
You can see the project on this url: http://109.173.167.138:3001/

### Overview:
The app uses JSON Server as a database and fetches albums, artists and songs from it. Then it renders albums on the Homepage view and passes data through props to smaller components, which also do GET requests to backend. App is based on the MVC project pattern.

I use Vue.router for navigating through components and transitions between them and a very simple Vuex store for the menu component.

It is a second version of the app. Project has been refactored very recently and there's many things that could've been done better, but it still looks much better than before.
